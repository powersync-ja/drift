  /// This shared worker, which we expect is a Dart program calling

  /// Just like for [dedicated] connections, the connection returned by
  /// [connectToDriftWorker] will use a message channel between the current
  /// context and the (potentially existing) shared worker.
  ///
  /// So, while every tab uses its own connection, they all connect to the same

  /// Note that shared worker may not be supported in all browsers.
  shared,

  /// This mode generally works very similar to [shared] in the sense that a
  /// shared worker is used and that all tabs calling [driftWorkerMain] get
  /// a view of the same database with synchronized stream queries.
  ///
  /// However, a technical difference is that the actual database is not opened
  /// in the shared worker itself. Instead, the shared worker creates a new
  /// [Worker] internally that will host the database and forwards incoming
  /// connections to this worker.
  /// Generally, it is recommended to use a [shared] worker. However, some
  /// database connections, such as the one based on the Origin-private File
  /// System web API, is only available in dedicated workers. This setup enables
  /// the use of such APIs.
  ///
  /// Note that only Firefox seems to support spawning dedicated workers in
  /// shared workers, which makes this option effectively unsupported on Chrome
  /// and Safari.

///
/// This function will detect whether it is running in a shared or in a
/// dedicated worker. In either case, the [openConnection] callback is invoked
/// to start a [DriftServer] that will serve drift database requests to clients.
///
/// When running in a shared worker, this function listens to
/// [SharedWorkerGlobalScope.onConnect] events and establishes message channels
/// with connecting clients to share a database.
/// In a dedicated worker, a [DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.postMessage]-construction
/// is used to establish a communication channel with clients.
/// To connect to this worker, the [connectToDriftWorker] function can be used.
///
/// As an example, a worker file could live in `web/database_worker.dart` and
/// have the following content:
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'dart:html';
///
/// import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
/// import 'package:drift/web.dart';
/// import 'package:drift/web/worker.dart';
///
/// void main() {
///   // Load sql.js library in the worker
///   WorkerGlobalScope.instance.importScripts('sql-wasm.js');
///
///   driftWorkerMain(() {
///     return WebDatabase.withStorage(DriftWebStorage.indexedDb('worker',
///         migrateFromLocalStorage: false, inWebWorker: true));
///   });
